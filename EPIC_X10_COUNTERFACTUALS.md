# EPIC X.10 – Counterfactuals ("What would change this decision?")

Introduces counterfactual reasoning to explain *how* a decision outcome
could be flipped with minimal feature changes.

## Backend
- CounterfactualEngine (pure logic)
- CounterfactualSuggestion model

## UI
- CounterfactualPanel (summary, no API coupling)

## Notes
- No wiring to live decisions yet
- Suggestions are heuristic and explainability-focused
